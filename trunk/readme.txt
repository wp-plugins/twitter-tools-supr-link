Makes the links that Twitter Tools posts to Twitter be API-created su.pr links so you can track the number of clicks and such via your su.pr account.

== Description ==

[Twitter Tools](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/) is an excellent plugin for posting notifications of new blog posts to [Twitter](http://twitter.com/). However Twitter Tools just sends the URL to the new post normally which is then shortened by Twitter itself to a [bit.ly](http://bit.ly/) short link. This is done anonymously.

This plugin will replace the normal URLs sent by Twitter Tools to Twitter with su.pr URLs tied to your Stumble Upon account. You can then easily track the number of clicks from your Stumble Upon profile.

This plugin is based on [twitter-tools-bitly-links](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools-bitly-links/) by Viper007Bond
